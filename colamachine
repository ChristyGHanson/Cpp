// Requires:
// variables, data types, and numerical operators
// basic input/output
// logic (if statements, switch statements)

// Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of 5 beverages.
// Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
// Output which beverage they chose.

// Challenge: ★ If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
// If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.

// Challenge: ★★ Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."

    //if //if 1, Baja Blast. if 2, Voltage, etc.
